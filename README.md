## Problem Statement
### Challenges in Tech Investing

**Misinformation**
- Fake or exaggerated technology news spreads rapidly across social and digital media  
- Investors find it difficult to identify credible and verified sources in real time  

**Time Constraints**
- Manual fact-checking is slow and resource-intensive  
- Markets often react before accurate verification is completed  

**Analysis Gap**
- Even verified news lacks a clear explanation of the financial and market impact  
- Investors struggle to convert information into actionable trading decisions  

**Emotional Trading**
- Fear of missing out (FOMO) and panic selling drive irrational behaviour  
- Sensational headlines lead to overreaction and increased risk  

### Impact
- Poor investment outcomes for retail investors  
- Increased market volatility driven by misinformation  
- Reduced trust in digital financial information systems  

### Problem Theme Alignment
This problem statement lies at the intersection of **FinTech** and **Generative AI**:

- **FinTech**: Addresses challenges in financial markets by improving decision-making, reducing misinformation-driven trades, and enhancing investor confidence through data-driven insights.  
- **Generative AI**: Leverages advanced language models to extract claims, verify information, generate explainable insights, and translate complex financial analysis into human-readable recommendations.

The project demonstrates how **Generative AI can be responsibly applied within financial technology** to solve real-world investment challenges.

### 2. Financial Impact Analysis
- Evaluates impact on stock prices and sectors  
- Uses historical patterns and market indicators  
- Assesses risk and volatility levels  

### 3. Explainable Insights

2. News Verification Agent  
   Verifies the authenticity of news, cross-checks multiple sources, and assigns confidence scores.

3. Financial Impact Agent  
   Analyses the impact of verified news on stock prices, market sentiment, and technology sectors.

4. Insight Generator  
   Combines verification and analysis to generate explainable Buy / Sell / Hold recommendations.

5. User Interface / API  
   Delivers verified news and insights through a dashboard, mobile app, or API endpoints.
